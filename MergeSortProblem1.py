# Problem Description
# Merge two sorted arrays of integers into a single sorted array
# Input
# Two lines, each line describes a sorted array. The first number in the line gives n, the number of integers in the array, 
# and the following n numbers give the n integers in the array, in ascending order. All numbers are separated by space.
# You can assume that 0 <= n <= 100000, and that each number in the arrarys are in the range of [-2147483648, 2147483647].

# Output
# One line, describing the merged sorted array, in ascending order. 
# The first integer should be the total number of integers in the merged array, 
# and the following integer(s) should give all numbers in the merged array (in ascending order). 
# All numbers should be separated with space.
